# Reflection - Tugba Agdas

## What I learned from this lesson

In this lesson I learned what Git and GitHub are and how developers collaborate using repositories.

I understood:
- What a repository is
- What a commit does
- How branches work
- What pull requests are used for
- How markdown formatting works

## What I am still confused about

I am still confused about:
- When to use forks instead of branches
- How large teams manage pull requests

## Final Thoughts

This lesson helped me understand how version control works and how developers share their work safely.
